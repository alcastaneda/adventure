Description: 
This is a basic Rails app based on the design and functionality of Imgur. We'll be using only animal pictures that users can upload via a url link. Users can upvote and downvote pictures, comment on pictures, upvote/downvote comments, search pictures by tags and titles, and sort pictures by popularity.
